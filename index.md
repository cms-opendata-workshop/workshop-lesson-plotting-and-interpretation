This exercise will walk you through the process of making some basic plots, once
you have skimmed some data and produced ROOT files. We'll make these plots
using ROOT and calling ROOT from python using the PyROOT module. Note, that you could
choose other approaches to making plots, such as using 
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), but the ROOT files need to be accessed with ROOT
or [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot) so we'll stick with ROOT for now. 

Once we've made the plots, we'll spend some time examining them and trying to interpret 
the distributions so that we can develop some intuition for how things look. 


If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers
through the dedicated 
[Mattermost channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsopendatatheo/channels/town-square).
