This lesson will walk us through how to plot and display the data
produced by the [Higgs to tau tau](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/12350)
exercise. It is *not* necessary for you to have done this lesson already, as we
will start by downloading the necessary starter files. 

You should have gone through the [ROOT pre-exercise](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-root/) in order to make sure you have a working ROOT 
environment.
